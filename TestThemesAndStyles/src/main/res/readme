11. Summary
To create a custom view that inherits the look and behavior of a View subclass such as EditText,
add a new class that extends that subclass, and make adjustments by overriding some of
the subclass's methods.

To create a custom view of any size and shape, add a new class that extends View.

Override View methods such as onDraw() to define the view's shape and basic appearance.

Use invalidate() to force a draw or redraw of the view.

To optimize performance, allocate variables and assign any required values for drawing and
painting before using them in onDraw(), such as in the initialization of member variables.

Override performClick() rather than OnClickListener() to the custom view to provide
the view's interactive behavior.
This enables your or other Android developers that may use your custom view class to use
onClickListener() to provide further behavior.

Add the custom view to an XML layout file with attributes to define its appearance, as you would
with other UI elements.
Create the attrs.xml file in the values folder to define custom attributes.
You can then use the custom attributes for the custom view in the XML layout file.
